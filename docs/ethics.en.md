# 🛡️ AgroProsper – Ethics Statement

AgroProsper is not just a digital platform — it is a community of trust. We believe that agri-innovation should serve the farmer, not the other way around.

## 🌾 Our Core Principles

### 1. 👣 Respect for Farmer Autonomy
- Data belongs to the farmer. We do not sell, aggregate, or share personal data without explicit consent.
- Users can leave the ecosystem and export their data at any time.

### 2. 🔍 Transparent by Default
- Algorithms influencing financial or operational decisions (e.g., market advice) are clearly marked as `AI-assisted`.
- Open Policy: our governance and decision-making principles are public (`governance.md`, `licensing.md`).

### 3. 🧩 Partnership Over Lock-In
- We do not practice vendor lock-in.
- Our API is open, and all data is exportable in clear formats (CSV, JSON).

### 4. ⚖️ Ethical Business Is Sustainable Business
- AgroProsper does not charge for access to basic market data.
- Paid features are delivered under a `value-for-value` principle.
