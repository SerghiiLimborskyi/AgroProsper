# 🌾 AgroProsper — Vision & Value Alignment

AgroProsper is a multilingual, farmer-centric platform that merges AI tools with open governance. We're building a new standard for agricultural data ownership, transparency, and trust in the Web3 era.

---

## 🎯 Problem We Address

Farmers today are bombarded with siloed dashboards, closed APIs, and black-box algorithms. Despite the influx of tools, few empower them with real ownership over data, logic, and decision-making.

---

## 💡 Our Vision

We believe in agrotech that’s:

- 🧭 Transparent and ethically grounded  
- 🔍 DAO-governed and open-source  
- 🧑‍🌾 Designed for the farmer, not against them

We deliver multilingual ethics statements, public governance charters, and a license that protects openness while encouraging ecosystem reuse.
